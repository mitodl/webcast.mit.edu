1) Padding is only placed on the top and/or bottom of the div. The elements within this div have padding on their sides. This saves you from any "box model math". Keep in mind, if you add any side padding or border to the div itself, it will be added to the width you define to create the *total* width. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.

    <p><strong>Tips for participating in a live  webcast:</strong><strong> <br />
      <br />
      </strong>If you are on a personal computer or laptop make sure you have a current  version of Adobe Flash installed. <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html">Go <strong>here</strong></a>&nbsp;and  follow the steps outlined on that page to make sure that you have an up to date  version of Adobe Flash installed.<br />
      <br />
      If you are viewing the live stream from a tablet or smartphone you will <strong>not</strong> need to install Adobe Flash.<br />
  <br />
      Use the best network  connection possible – wired is better than wireless. You can run a speed test <strong><u><a href="http://www.speedtest.net/">here</a></u></strong> to determine your download speed. <br />
      <br />
      Close all  applications except those necessary for the webcast. This frees up the computer  for better performance. A possible  cause of choppiness or pausing playback is insufficient CPU resources on the  broadcaster or the viewer side. Older computer's graphics cards may have a  difficult time encoding and decoding live and recorded video.&nbsp; We  recommend shutting down all other applications and browser tabs / windows while  broadcasting and viewing if you are experiencing playback problems.&nbsp;<br />
      <br />
      Particularly if you are watching at a school or in a corporate  environment, it is possible that a firewall or content filter is blocking  the live stream. If you see a black screen instead of the live video stream,  this is one of the possible causes. If you have any ad-blockers installed,  disable those in your browser. If you can talk to your network administrator or  control it yourself,<u>&nbsp;<a href="https://ustream.zendesk.com/entries/21119702-Opening-Firewall-Ports-for-Ustream-Broadcasting-and-Viewing">this </a></u><a href="https://ustream.zendesk.com/entries/21119702-Opening-Firewall-Ports-for-Ustream-Broadcasting-and-Viewing"><strong>article</strong></a>&nbsp;explains  which ports need to be enabled to allow live streaming through your firewall. If you are using a VPN, try disabling the VPN and  viewing while not connected with a VPN.<br />
      <br />
      If your  computer has a Power Plan (Energy-Saving settings), choose high performance. <br />
      If you’re  using a laptop, avoid running on battery - it can reduce performance.</p>
