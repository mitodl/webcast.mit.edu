00: 00: 01.661 -> 00: 00: 05.248
Welcome the topic "Basic Addition"

00: 00: 10.747 -> 00: 00: 15.064
hopefully it will be simple after this course, or in a few weeks

00: 00: 15.080 -> 00: 00: 18.287
Let's start with some pieces

00: 00: 23,354 -> 00: 00: 25,146
1 plus 1

00: 00: 26.069 -> 00: 00: 28.915
I think you already know how to fix it

00: 00: 28.915 -> 00: 00: 33.700
But I will show you a way to solve it if you have not already learned it outside

00: 00: 33,700 -> 00: 00: 35,438
or master it

00: 00: 36,646 -> 00: 00: 41,438
If I have one - let's call it an apple

00: 00: 41.438 -> 00: 00: 47.669
If I have an apple and you give me another apple

00: 00: 47.669 -> 00: 00: 50.145
How many apples do I have now?

00: 00: 50,146 -> 00: 00: 52,008
There is one, two apples

00: 00: 52,054 -> 00: 00: 55,546
Then 1 plus 1 equals 2

00: 00: 55.623 -> 00: 00: 56.684
I know what you're thinking:

00: 00: 56,700 -> 00: 00: 58,300
"It's all too easy!"

00: 00: 58,300 -> 00: 01: 01.138
So let me give you something harder

00: 01: 01.138 -> 00: 01: 02.600
I like to count on apples

00: 01: 02.677 -> 00: 01: 05.300
let's go on with it a little bit yet

00: 01: 05,300 -> 00: 01: 10,700
What is 3 plus 4?

00: 01: 10.700 -> 00: 01: 13.300
I think this is a little hard piece

00: 01: 13,300 -> 00: 01: 15,399
Let's continue with apples

00: 01: 25,000 -> 00: 01: 28,631
Let's say I have 3 apples

00: 01: 28,631 -> 00: 01: 30,000
1

00: 01: 30,000 -> 00: 01: 31,100
2

00: 01: 31.100 -> 00: 01: 32.800
3

00: 01: 32.800 -> 00: 01: 36.676
Let's say you have 4 apples

00: 01: 36,677 -> 00: 01: 41,500
I make them yellow so you know it's the ones you give me

00: 01: 41.500 -> 00: 01: 42.600
1

00: 01: 42,600 -> 00: 01: 43,399
2

00: 01: 43,400 -> 00: 01: 45,000
3

00: 01: 45,000 -> 00: 01: 47,000
4

00: 01: 47,000 -> 00: 01: 48,962
How many apples do we have now?

00: 01: 49.085 -> 00: 01: 50.169
There is

00: 01: 50.169 -> 00: 01: 51.154
1

00: 01: 51.169 -> 00: 01: 51.991
2

00: 01: 52.008 -> 00: 01: 52.800
3

00: 01: 52,800 -> 00: 01: 53,500
4

00: 01: 53,500 -> 00: 01: 54,100
5

00: 01: 54,100 -> 00: 01: 54,899
6

00: 01: 54.900 -> 00: 01: 56.438
7 apples

00: 01: 56.438 -> 00: 01: 59.769
So 3 plus 4 equals 7

00: 01: 59.769 -> 00: 02: 01.277
Now I will introduce you to another way to solve this task

00: 02: 01.308 -> 00: 02: 03.308
also called a number series

00: 02: 09,699 -> 00: 02: 11,831
In the speech series I write all the numbers in sequence

00: 02: 11.831 -> 00: 02: 16.899
and I write many numbers so that all the numbers I use are among those written on the speech series

00: 02: 16.900 -> 00: 02: 18.969
We start with 0

00: 02: 21,200 -> 00: 02: 36,976
And then we say 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

00: 02: 37,069 -> 00: 02: 39,476
It continues: 11, ...

00: 02: 39,477 -> 00: 02: 40,892
We say 3 plus 4

00: 02: 40.985 -> 00: 02: 43.046
We therefore start at 3

00: 02: 43.046 -> 00: 02: 45.146
I have 3 here

00: 02: 45,146 -> 00: 02: 46,899
and we will put 4 to the 3

00: 02: 46.900 -> 00: 02: 49.400
What you do is move

00: 02: 49,400 -> 00: 02: 50,285
to the right of his speech series

00: 02: 50.285 -> 00: 02: 52.008
4 more

00: 02: 53,100 -> 00: 02: 54,500
1

00: 02: 54,500 -> 00: 02: 55,700
2

00: 02: 55.700 -> 00: 02: 57.200
3

00: 02: 57.200 -> 00: 03: 00.100
4

00: 03: 00.100 -> 00: 03: 01.677
so all we do is increase it by 1

00: 03: 01.677 -> 00: 03: 02.415
2

00: 03: 02.431 -> 00: 03: 02.931
3

00: 03: 02.931 -> 00: 03: 03.508
4

00: 03: 03.508 -> 00: 03: 04.969
and then we end at 7

00: 03: 04.969 -> 00: 03: 07.200
and that is our answer

00: 03: 07.200 -> 00: 03: 08.191
Let's try with a few more pieces

00: 03: 10.800 -> 00: 03: 13.315
What if I asked you what 8 plus 1 is?

00: 03: 14,923 -> 00: 03: 16,100
You may already know

00: 03: 16,100 -> 00: 03: 17,600
8 plus 1 is just the next number

00: 03: 17,600 -> 00: 03: 19,100
but if we look at the speech series

00: 03: 19,100 -> 00: 03: 21,100
then you start at 8

00: 03: 21,100 -> 00: 03: 23,500
and adds 1

00: 03: 23,500 -> 00: 03: 25,700
8 plus 1 equals 9

00: 03: 28.762 -> 00: 03: 31.208
let's try with a few more pieces

00: 03: 31.208 -> 00: 03: 33.100
and just so you know it

00: 03: 33,100 -> 00: 03: 33,799
if you are a little scared to start with

00: 03: 33,800 -> 00: 03: 35,500
You can always draw the circles

00: 03: 35,500 -> 00: 03: 37,400
You can always draw the series

00: 03: 37,400 -> 00: 03: 38,800
and gradually over time

00: 03: 38.800 -> 00: 03: 40.200
The more training you get

00: 03: 40,200 -> 00: 03: 41,353
then you will hopefully learn this outwardly

00: 03: 41,354 -> 00: 03: 43.238
and then it will be in half a second

00: 03: 43.238 -> 00: 03: 44.192
I promise you

00: 03: 44.192 -> 00: 03: 46.115
just keep on exercising

00: 03: 47,600 -> 00: 03: 48,631
I draw the number of words again

00: 04: 07.900 -> 00: 04: 08.538

00: 04: 08.569 -> 00: 04: 09.208
1

00: 04: 09.208 -> 00: 04: 10.523
2

00: 04: 10.523 -> 00: 04: 12.200
3

00: 04: 12,200 -> 00: 04: 13,299
4

00: 04: 13,300 -> 00: 04: 14,900
5

00: 04: 14.900 -> 00: 04: 16.100
6

00: 04: 16,100 -> 00: 04: 17,400
7

00: 04: 17.399 -> 00: 04: 18.500
8

00: 04: 18,500 -> 00: 04: 20,100
9

00: 04: 20,100 -> 00: 04: 21,500
10

00: 04: 21.500 -> 00: 04: 22.900
11

00: 04: 22.900 -> 00: 04: 24.299
12

00: 04: 24,300 -> 00: 04: 25,700
13

00: 04: 25,700 -> 00: 04: 27,099
14

00: 04: 27,100 -> 00: 04: 29,600
15

00: 04: 29,600 -> 00: 04: 31,723
Let's solve a hard piece

00: 04: 31.723 -> 00: 04: 34.046
what is...

00: 04: 34.046 -> 00: 04: 36.200
We make it in different colors

00: 04: 36,200 -> 00: 04: 39,361
What is 5 plus 6?

00: 04: 39.377 -> 00: 04: 41.300
If you want, you can pause the video and try it

00: 04: 41,300 -> 00: 04: 43,300
You may already know the answer

00: 04: 43,300 -> 00: 04: 45,708
The reason I say it is a difficult issue is because

00: 04: 45,708 -> 00: 04: 48,685
The answer has more numbers than fingers

00: 04: 48.685 -> 00: 04: 51.700
so you can not calculate it on your fingers

00: 04: 59.000 -> 00: 05: 03.008
Let's start with 5

00: 05: 05,200 -> 00: 05: 06,692
and we will add 6 to it

00: 05: 06,692 -> 00: 05: 07,600
We go to the right

00: 05: 07,600 -> 00: 05: 08,500
1

00: 05: 08.500 -> 00: 05: 09.700
2

00: 05: 09.700 -> 00: 05: 10.800
3

00: 05: 10.800 -> 00: 05: 11.700
4

00: 05: 11.700 -> 00: 05: 13.200
5

00: 05: 13,200 -> 00: 05: 15,599
6

00: 05: 15,600 -> 00: 05: 17,700
and we end at 11

00: 05: 17.700 -> 00: 05: 20.346
So 5 plus 6 equals 11

00: 05: 22,200 -> 00: 05: 23,777
What is 6 plus 5?

00: 05: 29.685 -> 00: 05: 31.338
Can you turn the piece over and still get the same answer?

00: 05: 31.338 -> 00: 05: 32.708
Let's try it

00: 05: 32.708 -> 00: 05: 33.715
I will try to do it in a different color

00: 05: 33.715 -> 00: 05: 35.361
so we do not get confused

00: 05: 35.362 -> 00: 05: 37.638
Let's start at 6

00: 05: 37,638 -> 00: 05: 39,400
ignore the yellow

00: 05: 39,400 -> 00: 05: 41,000
and add 5 to

00: 05: 41,000 -> 00: 05: 42,000
1

00: 05: 42,000 -> 00: 05: 43,100
2

00: 05: 43,100 -> 00: 05: 44,300
3

00: 05: 44,300 -> 00: 05: 45,000
4

00: 05: 45,000 -> 00: 05: 45,500
5

00: 05: 46,100 -> 00: 05: 48,200
We used to know the same number.

00: 05: 48,200 -> 00: 05: 49,392
You may want to try it on other pieces

00: 05: 49.392 -> 00: 05: 51.207
and discover that the result is the same every time

00: 05: 51.208 -> 00: 05: 53.700
It does not matter which order the numbers are in, the result will be the same

00: 05: 53,700 -> 00: 05: 56,069
5 plus 6 is the same as 6 plus 5

00: 05: 56.069 -> 00: 05: 57.285
It makes sense

00: 05: 57.285 -> 00: 06: 00.146
If I have 5 apples and you give 6, then I have 11

00: 06: 00,146 -> 00: 06: 03,200
If I have 6 and you give me 5, I will also have 11

00: 06: 05,462 -> 00: 06: 07,146
Because the talk is easy to work with

00: 06: 07,146 -> 00: 06: 08,738
Then I will continue a little bit with it

00: 06: 08.738 -> 00: 06: 10.862
Although I'm sure I'm going to confuse you

00: 06: 10.862 -> 00: 06: 12.315
because I write so much on it

00: 06: 13.685 -> 00: 06: 14.908
let's try to see

00: 06: 14,908 -> 00: 06: 15,846
I want to use white now

00: 06: 16,877 -> 00: 06: 22,923
What is 8 plus 7?

00: 06: 25,031 -> 00: 06: 27,469
8 is right there

00: 06: 27.469 -> 00: 06: 29.346
And we have to add 7 to

00: 06: 29.438 -> 00: 06: 30.223
1

00: 06: 30.223 -> 00: 06: 31.115
2

00: 06: 31.115 -> 00: 06: 32.546
3

00: 06: 32.546 -> 00: 06: 33.592
4

00: 06: 33.592 -> 00: 06: 34.800
5

00: 06: 34,800 -> 00: 06: 35,600
6

00: 06: 35,600 -> 00: 06: 37,308
7

00: 06: 37,308 -> 00: 06: 39,300
We end at 15

00: 06: 39,300 -> 00: 06: 43,500
8 plus 7 equals 15

00: 06: 43.500 -> 00: 06: 47.500
Hopefully this video gives you an idea of ??how to solve these calculations

00: 07: 24.592 -> 00: 07: 26.176
You can always press "Hints" and get help

00: 07: 26.177 -> 00: 07: 27.600
and you will see the circles

00: 07: 27,600 -> 00: 07: 28,977
You will be able to count the circles

00: 07: 33,100 -> 00: 07: 35,000
or you can draw a row

00: 07: 35,000 -> 00: 07: 37,700
just like we have done in this video

00: 07: 37,700 -> 00: 07: 40,599
I now think you're ready for more add-ons
